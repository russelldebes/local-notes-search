## What this is

`local-notes-search` is a local-first CLI for semantic search and RAG over a
folder of Markdown notes (built for an Obsidian vault). Everything runs on the
user's machine — notes never leave it.

- **Language / runtime:** Python ≥ 3.11, managed by [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- **Models:** served by a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) instance.
  `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings, `llama3.2:3b` for RAG answers (configurable).
- **Vector store:** [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com) — embedded, file-based, no server.
- **Change tracking:** plain stdlib `sqlite3` manifest (content hashes). No
  loadable SQLite extensions are used (system Python disables them), so it works
  everywhere — this is *why* we use LanceDB instead of `sqlite-vec`.
- **Output / UX:** `rich` for the terminal REPL.

## Architecture

The flow: notes → chunk → embed → LanceDB; a query is embedded, similarity-
searched, then either shown as ranked passages or fed to the LLM for a cited answer.

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `notes_search/config.py` | Config resolution: defaults ← `config.toml` ← `NOTES_VAULT_PATH` env ← `--vault` flag |
| `notes_search/ollama_client.py` | Ollama wrapper: health check (friendly fix commands), embed, streaming chat |
| `notes_search/chunker.py` | Markdown-aware chunking: strip frontmatter, track heading breadcrumbs, overlapping windows, prepend title+breadcrumb to each chunk |
| `notes_search/store.py` | Persistence: LanceDB vectors + sqlite `files` manifest |
| `notes_search/indexer.py` | Incremental reindex: hash files, (re)embed new/changed, purge deleted |
| `notes_search/rag.py` | RAG system + user prompt construction |
| `notes_search/cli.py` | REPL, slash commands, arg parsing, entry point (`main`) |

## Running & developing

```bash
uv sync                              # install deps
uv run notes-search                  # index changed notes, then REPL
uv run notes-search --reindex-only   # index and exit (no prompt)
uv run notes-search --vault PATH     # override the configured vault
```

REPL commands: `/answer` (default, RAG), `/chunks` (raw passages), `/reindex`,
`/stats`, `/help`, `/quit`.

Syntax-check without the deps installed: `python3 -m py_compile notes_search/*.py`.

## Conventions

- Keep modules single-purpose; the table above is the contract.
- Ollama failures must stay actionable: surface the exact `ollama serve` /
  `ollama pull <model>` command the user should run, never a raw traceback.
- The startup index only requires the embedding model. The chat model is checked
  *lazily*, only when answer mode is actually used — don't block `/chunks`-only
  users on a model they don't need.
- Change detection is by **content hash**, not mtime. Re-embedding a note must
  first delete its old chunks (`store.delete_chunks(path)`) to avoid duplicates.
- Each chunk is prefixed with its note title + heading breadcrumb before
  embedding; this context materially improves retrieval — preserve it.
- `_scan_vault` skips any `.md` inside a hidden directory (a path component
  starting with "."). This keeps Obsidian's `.trash` (deleted notes) and
  `.obsidian` (config/plugins) out of the index. The vault path may point at a
  parent folder of several vaults — the walk is recursive and combines them.

## Things that will trip you up

- **`config.toml` and `.notes_index/` are gitignored** — they hold the user's
  personal vault path and embedded notes. Never commit them. Only
  `config.example.toml` ships.
- **Ollama server must be running** (`ollama serve`) before embed/chat calls.
- **Environment PATH (this dev machine):** Homebrew lives at `/opt/homebrew/bin`
  but non-interactive shells may not load it. If `uv`/`ollama` are "command not
  found", prepend `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`.
- LanceDB delete uses a SQL filter string — single quotes in paths are escaped by
  doubling (`store._escape`). Don't switch to naive string interpolation.

## Conversation state (answer mode is conversational)

Answer mode remembers the conversation so follow-ups resolve against earlier turns
("How tall is he?" after "What about Russell?"). The REPL holds a `history` list of
`{role, content}` turns (`cli.py::_repl`), bounded by `cfg.history_turns` (config
`[chat] history_turns`, default 6; set 0 to disable and go fully stateless).

Two-part design — **both parts are required**, don't remove either:

1. **Query rewrite before retrieval** (`ollama_client.rewrite_query` +
   `rag.build_rewrite_prompt`). Retrieval embeds only literal words, so a raw
   follow-up like "how tall is he?" would miss the right note. When history exists,
   the follow-up is first rewritten into a standalone query (temp 0), and *that* is
   what gets embedded/searched. The rewritten query is shown to the user as
   `↳ interpreting as: …`.
2. **History in the generation prompt** (`chat_stream(..., history=...)`) for
   conversational continuity/tone.

Turns are recorded with the user's *original* wording (not the rewrite). `/clear`
empties `history`. **Chunks mode is intentionally stateless** — it neither reads nor
writes history; it's a plain lookup. If you ever ship history-in-prompt without the
rewrite step, follow-ups will *sound* like they work while retrieval silently fails.

## Not yet built (open ideas)

One-shot `--query "..."` non-interactive mode; `.txt`/other extensions alongside
`.md`; reranking; configurable `keep_alive`; tests.
